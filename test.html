        1. So far, I have made progress on sourcing data, as well as creating
        two simple initial prototypes for some planned visualizations. The
        functionality of the first visualization seems to more or less work
        correctly, and the slider of the second also works. The search bar and
        highlighting is a WIP. I have a general idea of the other two
        visualizations I want to implement. I also have a good idea on what I
        want each graph to look like. I have a skeleton HTML for further
        implementation. I am also working on a method to scrape further data in
        python. My current data is from these links:<br />

        >
        <br />
        The data from here comes from metasrc.com, a website which includes
        further data from other patches not included in these two datasets.
        Potentially, it would be cool to include all available patches in the
        future.

        2. I want to try my hand at adding a visualization showing the highest
        winrate champion of a role on a map of the game (so if Urgot is the
        highest winrate in the top lane, I want to have a little bubble with his
        pictures pointing at the top lane). Either way, adding animations and
        making the website look and run smoother is probably going to be the
        most challenging part of the design. For example, for the highlighted
        slider, I want the bars to shift smoothly while the slider moves, so
        that the highlighted bar of the champion can be followed with the eyes.
        In order to communicate that a champion should be selected, all bars
        should have their opacity lowered before a champion is selected and
        highlighted (opacity back to 1).
